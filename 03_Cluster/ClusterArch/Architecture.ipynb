    "# HPC Cluster Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "HPC stands for high performance computing, and a cluster is a collection of computers in this context. HPC computing was invented to make the computation of large problems feasible. Problems are traditionally in the fields of science and engineering - think of weather forecasting. But today, there are many more application areas, like machine learning and finance, that profit from large computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "HPC focuses mainly on heavy number crunching, but associated with it, we often see large data volume and data visualization challenges. Efficient handling of large data volumes and data visualization capabilities are therefore an integral part of HPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build an HPC cluster, not only compute power, but also considerations such as space and power consumtion, weight and cooling, cabling, component resilience, homogeneity and ease of maintenance, application and user skill compatibility, plus finances, have to be taken into account - quite a complex undertaking, depending on the size of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some evolutionary iterations, taking economic and technical restrictions into account, the current standard of HPC cluster architecture looks more or less like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Externally accessible head nodes\n",
    "* A big amount of compute nodes with\n",
    "   * Standard CPUs with large cache per core, high memory bandwidth per core, and capable SIMD units (Intel, AMD, Fujitsu, Arm)\n",
    "   * Standard GPUs with good double precision float support, high internal and external memory bandwidth, connected via fast bus systems (AMD, Nvidia, newer PCIE, NVLink, ...)\n",
    "* Storage nodes with a high performance parallel file system (BeeGFS, Lustre, IBM Spectrum Scale, ...)\n",
    "   * Sometimes with separate IO network\n",
    "* Standard or specialized high performance interconnects (Infiniband, Slingshot, Tofu, ...)\n",
    "* Standard rack mounts\n",
    "* Higher density blades with remote management capabilities\n",
    "* Air or water cooling and redundant power supplies\n",
    "* Separate management network\n",

    "## Example: PSI Merlin6\n",
    "\n",
    "Merlin6 is the old PSI cluster (about 4 hardware generations back). It grew organically, scraping together funds from diverse research groups with sometimes special needs. Therefore it shows considerable heterogeneity.\n",
