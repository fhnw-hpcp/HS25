# High Performance Computing in Practice - HS25
Welcome to the HPCP block module! This repository is organized to mirror the course structure, with a dedicated directory for each day.

This summer school targets advanced students and researchers seeking a hands-on introduction to modern High Performance Computing (HPC) methods. The course consists of four full-day modules:

- **Day 1 – From vanilla Python to HPC Python:**  
    Explore high-performance Python computing using numpy, numba, jax, and Python C/C++ bindings. Learn about JIT compilation, automatic differentiation, efficient memory access, and performance analysis fundamentals.

- **Day 2 – Using GPUs to accelerate your code:**  
    Learn the basics of GPU programming with numba.cuda, develop and optimize custom GPU kernels, and get an overview of the CUDA ecosystem and GPU profiling.

- **Day 3 – Cluster 101:**  
    Get introduced to HPC cluster environments, job submission with Slurm, module systems, parallel programming with MPI (via mpi4py), and initial performance analysis of multi-process workloads.

- **Day 4 – Advanced HPC usage:**  
    Delve into advanced parallel programming with MPI and GPUs, tackle challenges with shared HPC file systems, and study a real-world application: HPC in the ESA Euclid space mission.

All modules use Python and interactive Jupyter notebooks for practical, hands-on learning.
